# MNIST Deep Learning with PyTorch

This project implements a simple deep neural network using PyTorch to classify MNIST handwritten digits.

## Structure:
- `models/`: Defines the neural network architecture.
- `data/`: Handles data loading.
- `train/`: Contains training and evaluation scripts.
- `notebook/`: Jupyter Notebook for testing the trained model.

## Setup:
Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
